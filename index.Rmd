The data is about weather in New York state, collected by New York state weather stations from January 1, 1981 through December 31, 2010. 

Three plots are made to compare the snowfall and snow depth, the number of snowy days and temperature across time.

`Chart A`

We can see that the snow depth decreases across the time given the similar snowfall.

`Chart B`

There is a broad trend that the numbers of snowy days are decreasing across time.

`Chart C`

The median of maximum temperature in a day is periodically fluctuated across time.
